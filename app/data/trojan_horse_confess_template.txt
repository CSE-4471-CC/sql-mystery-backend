Confessions

I feel extremely guilty. After Tony Stark decided to go with Jarvis's security plan 
for Stark Industries' security system upgrade, I just snapped. I hacked into Pepper Pott's 
company account to look at Tony's questionnaire answers. Once I saw that he had an almond allergy 
and his favorite drink is coffee, I had a sinister idea.

I ordered almond coffee creamer and poured it into a normal creamer bottle. Then, I suggested to 
the new assistant that he keep refilling Tony's coffee cup since he's been working late hours with 
the new system launch. The next day, we came into the office and discovered that Tony had passed away. 

I am guilty of the murder of Tony Stark.
